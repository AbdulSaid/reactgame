# React Clicky NBA Game
In this app, I created a memory game. The application renders different images to the screen. I chose NBA players. The application keeps track of user's score. User's score gets incremented when clicking an image for the first time. Then the user score goes up each time the user selects a new image. The user score gets reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
